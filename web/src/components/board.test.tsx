/**
 * The board's two hands, and the card a phone can finally read.
 *
 * Both properties here are about *where a thing is drawn*, which is exactly
 * what a green suite normally cannot see — so they are held as structure
 * rather than as pixels.
 *
 * A hand is not on the battlefield. It used to be drawn as though it were: a
 * full-width row in the same stack as lands and creatures, one per seat, so
 * two players cost eight rows and two of them were cards nobody had played
 * yet. The field is for what has been committed to it.
 *
 * And the card preview was `:hover` and `:focus-visible`, which a phone is
 * neither — forty cards on a floor, none readable at forty pixels, and the one
 * mechanism that made them readable needed a pointer nobody on a touch screen
 * has.
